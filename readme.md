## Overview
Cold messaging can yield better results when reaching a larger audience. This bot is designed to be a free and easy-to-use solution to automate the cold messaging process. It is especially useful for marketing agencies looking to streamline their outreach efforts and achieve better results.

In this example, the bot was utilized by a local graphic designer targeting cafes in the Borivali West area. Even within this small target group, the bot proved to be highly effective.
